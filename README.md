Gastrointestinal Image Segmentation
Overview
This project focuses on Gastrointestinal (GI) Image Segmentation using a U-Net model. The project encompasses the entire lifecycle, from data collection and preprocessing to building an interactive Streamlit app for visualizing segmentation results.

Key Features
Data Collection: Curated a dataset of gastrointestinal images suitable for segmentation tasks.
Data Preprocessing: Prepared and preprocessed the dataset to meet the requirements of the U-Net model.
U-Net Model: Implemented a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation of gastrointestinal images.
Streamlit App: Developed an interactive Streamlit application for real-time visualization of segmentation predictions.
Project Structure
data/: Directory containing the collected and preprocessed dataset.
models/: Location for storing the trained U-Net model .
app.py: Main file for the Streamlit application.
